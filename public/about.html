  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>Hello!</p>

  <p>
    My name is Rog√©rio Eduardo. I am 21 years old. I was born and grew-up in Nampula, Mozambique, but I am currently living 
    in the capital city, Maputo, where I am studying Electronic Engineering in the Eduardo Mondlane University.
  </p>

  <p>
    If I had to tell something about me is that I love learning, and programming has just being my passion in the last days. 
    From English and social sciences, to mathematics and natural sciences, which dragged me to enginnering and technology matters
    and motivated me to attend Electronic Engineering course in which I have learnt a lot about electronics so far, here I am, 
    once again, putting my hands in a field that is considered challenging but worthwhile - web development.
  </p>

  <p>
    I decided to start learning web development as a part of a personal project that I call LIS(Learning In-demand Skills).
    By the end of my course(in nearly 2 years), I am optimistic that I will have learned a lot and been far more skilful and confident.

    In my free time, I like practising sport. Honestly, it makes me feel awesome! Maybe there is something seamlessly going on in my body
    that is beyond the effects of strenghtening the muscles. I also like listening to music, mostly my native-language songs(Emakhuwa). Ooh,
    I should also say that I love knowing new people and learning from them. Actually, this is sometimes my favourite hobby,[laughters]! 
  </p>
  <p>That was me, thank you for visiting my page!</p>
