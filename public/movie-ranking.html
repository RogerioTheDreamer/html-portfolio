    <h3>Best Friends in the World</h3>
    <p>This is not actually a movie, but  a negerian series that marked my teenage.</p>
    <p>This movie emphasizes true relationship and exploits the different scenarios teenagers can go through in finding their partners, friends as well as with their parents.</p>
